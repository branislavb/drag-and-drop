# Drag & Drop Exercise

This is an opportunity for you to demonstrate visual interaction savvy on top of a simple drag & drop interaction. Implementing drag & drop is not meant to be challenging, but rather a neutral canvas on which you can show off techniques for making the interaction more engaging and fun.

**Show us your creativity!** Add pleasing transitions, animations, reactivity, anything to make the experience more engaging.
Our team draws inspiration from [sites](https://ca.la/) [like](https://kubrick.life/) [these](https://findingctrl.nesta.org.uk/), so show us something that will catch our eye!

You should choose one of the subdirectories to work within, depending on the framework (if any) you want to start with.

## Interaction Requirements

A user should be able to:
* Drag modules from the left to the right
* Drag modules from the right to the left
* Drag modules on the right up and down to sort
* Increment and decrement the number of exercises in each module
* Click the "Save" button

When the "Save" button is clicked:
* Print out a data structure of your choice that represents the course with its sorted modules using `console.log`.
* Display the "Saved" overlay, and then hide it again.
