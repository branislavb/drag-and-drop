# Drag & Drop Exercise

## Requirements

A user should be able to:
* Drag modules from the left to the right
* Drag modules from the right to the left
* Drag modules on the right up and down to sort
* Increment and decrement the number of exercises in each module
* Click the "Save" button

When the "Save" button is clicked:

* Display the "Saved" overlay, and then hide it again.
